# Summary

# Statement of need
Geophysical models of the Earth often produce results that are hard to interpret due to inherently heterogeneous and complex nature of the Earth systems. Results and models of experimental petrology and mineral physics studies had been utilised to make quantified interpretations that is more grounded in reality than speculation of physical phenomena. These studies include the investigation of geophysical parameters such as electrical conductivity, seismic velocity and magnetic susceptibility of minerals and rocks; petrological examination of phase transitions; solidus and liquidus curves of rock assemblages; major or trace element partitioning and solubilities of minerals; phase mixing functions. There are such tools for each individual elements (e.g., Ozaydin & Selway; Abers & Hacker, 2016). Things like LitMod, have such uses but limited choice of selection of models and ease of means to update them.

However, there are no major tool combining all topics to make a robust interpretation.

These are not in library form with the ease of use for other software packages and libraries can utilise with ease

Such a toolset will help accelerate the processes combining the petrological observations and 

For instance, magnetotelluric (MT) models of the Earth

 Experimental petrology studies can help aide in
