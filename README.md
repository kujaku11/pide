# About
*pide* is a Python3 library for calculating geophysical parameters (e.g., electrical conductivity, seismic velocity), employing the results from experimental petrology, mineral/rock physics, and thermomechanical modelling studies. *pide* can calculate the theoretical electrical conductivity of any earth material that exists in the literature. *pide* can also calculate seismic velocity utilising the external 'sister' library *satex*. Using these theoretical calculations, users can utilise inversion modules to decode geophysical anomalies compositionally or convert thermomechanical models into geophysical observables. With a given spatial mapping of earth materials, which can preferentially be loaded from a thermomechanical model, *pide*  can be used to build synthetic electrical conductivity and seismic velocity models and generate gravity and magnetic anomalies. Moreover, it is built as a modular tool, so users can easily build their functions.
